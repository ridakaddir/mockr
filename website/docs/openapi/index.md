# OpenAPI Generation

[Home](/) > OpenAPI

---

Generate a complete mockr config directory from an OpenAPI 3 spec in one command. Works with local files and remote URLs.

```sh
mockr generate --spec openapi.yaml --out ./mocks
mockr --config ./mocks
```

Your mock server is running with routes for every operation in the spec — no editing required.
