mockr supports gRPC mock and proxy alongside the HTTP server — both run in the same process, activated by `--grpc-proto`.

## How it works

1. Provide one or more `.proto` files via `--grpc-proto` — no `protoc` or code generation required
2. Define `[[grpc_routes]]` in your config files alongside existing `[[routes]]`
3. mockr starts a gRPC server on `--grpc-port` (default 50051) and an HTTP server on `--port` (default 4000)
4. Incoming gRPC calls are matched by full method path, decoded from protobuf to JSON for condition evaluation, and the stub response is encoded back to protobuf wire format
5. Unmatched calls are forwarded to `--grpc-target` if set, or return `UNIMPLEMENTED`

## Key features

- **No protoc** — mockr parses `.proto` files at runtime using reflection
- **Unary mocking** — stub responses with protojson (JSON with proto field names)
- **Condition routing** — route calls to different cases based on request body fields
- **Proxy fallthrough** — forward unmatched methods to an upstream gRPC server
- **Directory persistence** — stateful CRUD operations on directory-based stub files
- **Transitions** — time-based response progression, same as HTTP
- **Server reflection** — `grpcurl` and `grpc-ui` work out of the box
